The objective of this repository is to teach kids about react-JS web development by directing them to build an existing app that they are familiar with.

## Architecture

We are using a ReactJS front-end for building this application. For most aspects of this application, this is sufficient. Although, storing the clicked pictures will become a problem because of the memory limit on the localStorage of the browser.

So for the advanced students, we shall also create an ExpressJS backend which can store the files in a file-system instead of the browser.
